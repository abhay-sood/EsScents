# EsScents: Your centralized one stop website for fragrances

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a centralized, one-stop website for fragrances that offers a seamless browsing experience. The site will provide product recommendations, reviews, and general information about various fragrances. Built using React for a clean, organized, and efficient user interface, the website will leverage Python as the main backend language for effective data collection and manipulation. The application will be deployed on the cloud for ease of access.

## Deliverables
At the end of this project, we expect to deliver the following tangible outcomes:

A fully accessible and functional website with a clean user interface (UI).

A search feature enabling users to find detailed information about fragrances, including notes, performance, and pricing.

A machine learning component that provides personalized fragrance recommendations based on user preferences.

A comparison feature allowing users to view and compare two fragrances side by side.

An AI-powered product summary generator that analyzes existing reviews to summarize customer feedback.

A price tracking tool that notifies users of price drops on selected fragrances, similar to flight ticket tracking.
